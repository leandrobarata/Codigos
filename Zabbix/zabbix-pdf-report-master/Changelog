	* index.php: Uses Jquery Calendar to select range for custom timeframe
	* index.php: Uses Jquery Selector2 where you can search in the select

2015-03-13  Martin Møller <mmo@pwc.dk>
	* user.authenticate replaced with user.login. It seems that
	user.authenticate died with 1.8.x and even 1.8.x. has user.login
	* Started porting my trigger/acknowledgement implementation to this
	version of the report.

2015-03-14  Martin Møller <mmo@pwc.dk>
	* Trigger/Acknowledgements pretty much working.
	* Option to choose Graphs and/or Trigger data
	* Initial work on user login and limit view of existing reports.
	* Initial handling of international characters in PDF data.

2015-03-15  Martin Møller <mmo@pwc.dk>
	* Login page now operational. Limiting of old reports working.
	* Full session support, including logout should now be in place.

2015-03-19  Martin Møller <mmo@pwc.dk> - Update to v0.8
	* Fixed some bugs in various files that made the Company text
	unreadable.
	* Fixed margins so text and graphs will stay withing bounds.
	* Adjusted placement of $company_logo a bit to stay within red box.
	* Changed color of text for $company_logo to white in stead of red
	like the box already is. You can adjust this in pdf.functions.php.
	* Reimplemented international characters via iconv in the explode call
	of ezText in class.ezpdf.php.
	* Made the login form an option in config.inc.php. $user_login=1 will
	prompt for login. $user_login=0 will use the supplied $z_user and
	$z_pass directly.
	* Changed placement of logo, as it seems to be placed outside the
	page. Adjust to your liking in createpdf.php, search for $pdf_logo.

2015-03-24  Martin Møller <mmo@pwc.dk> - Update to v0.9
	* Changed fonts to be slightly smaller, fitting better on the page.
	* Fixed my selector names to not conflict with already used variables.
	* ^-> $graphs has been renamed $GraphsOn, and $triggers to $TriggersOn
	* More frequent debug output updates
	* $version variable introduced in config.inc.php
	
2015-04-08  Martin Møller <mmo@pwc.dk>
	* Added ability to show select items status in report, including debug
	* Added option to generate report on localhost without requiring login
	* Various small bugfixes to support the above
	* >> Adjust $items in config.inc.php to your liking <<

2016-10-03 Martin Møller <mmo@pwc.dk> - Update to v0.9.3
	* Trend data (average) implemented, but somewhat in beta.
	* Slight optimizations to the report layout.
	* Tested on Zabbix 3.0. Trends will of course not work on earlier
	versions.

2016-10-05 Martin Møller <mmo@pwc.dk> - Update to v0.9.4
	* Rudimentary graph selection via config.inc.php implemented. A more
	userfacing solution is still a bit in the future. 

2016-10-07 Martin Møller <mmo@pwc.dk> - Update to v0.9.5
	* More humanized names for certain values - expanding $1 via key_
	* Make entries with macros in the title more readable by removing
	these in our text-output.

2018-03-12 Martin Møller <mmo@pwc.dk> - Update to v0.9.6
	* Adapted __logout function to work with Zabbix 3.4 - hopefully
	previous versions still work. Old syntax is commented in __logout
	function in inc/ZabbixAPI.class.php

2018-03-12 Martin Møller <mmo@pwc.dk>
	* Double linebreak after each data-section for better legibility
	* Fixed issue with graphs not following the scheduled time if custom

2018-09-13 Martin Møller <mmo@pwc.dk>
	* Modified Chooser and CreatePDF to support subgroups, replacing /
	with --
	* Added support for overriding the preselected graphs with your own
	statement at report generation time. No full list of graphs to check
	or uncheck as of yet, but this should work for most people.

2018-10-17 Martin Møller <mmo@pwc.dk> - Update to v1.0.0
	* Implemented the possibility of including simple graphs of numeric
	items without having to make a dedicated graph for it.
	* Allowed override of the things you want included like $mygraphs
	* Show version number at login and chooser screens

2018-10-18 Martin Møller <mmo@pwc.dk> - Update to v1.0.1
	* Defined $stime for predefined periods as well, just in case. At
	least it makes it easier in DEBUG to see then the period starts.

2018-10-20 Martin Møller <mmo@pwc.dk> - Update to v1.1.0
	* Fixed issue with graphs not displaying the correct time interval in Zabbix 4.x, unless you happened to have chosen last hour. Should still work with older versions. 
	* Fixed the first bug (the issue above) : https://github.com/martinm76/zabbix-pdf-report/issues/1 (inc/createpdf.functions.php)

2018-10-21 Martin Møller <mmo@pwc.dk> - Update to v1.1.1
	* Implemented basic scaler for Company Name on the front page. May not always work well, but should be better than what went before. (inc/pdf.functions.php)
	* Hopefully fixed the annoying issue of some titles for graphs being on the previous page by limiting number of graphs per page to 3. (inc/createpdf.functions.php)
	* Fixed a couple of date calls using 'm' for minutes in stead of 'i'
	* Tried to optimize page layout with both single host and hostgroup.

2018-10-24 Martin Møller <mmo@pwc.dk> 
	* Updated all Javascript files and some CSS files to newest versions

2018-10-30 Martin Møller <mmo@pwc.dk> 
	* Adjusted various parameters regarding layout of the report and other
	minor tweaks.

2020-07-05 Martin Møller <martin.moller@pwc.com> - Update to v1.2.x
	* Fixed issue in index.php with = in stead of == if user login is
	disabled
	* Updated jQuery to 3.5.1
	* Fixed references to previously removed 3.3.1 version in chooser.php
	* Updated datetimepicker to latest available
	  - It seems there is incompatibility with current jQuery though
	  - There is a date/time picker, but very generic
	* Adjusted scaler formula for company name in PDF
	  - Should stay within page size in most cases now
	* Disabled curl debugging, which apparently was enabled before.
	* Added rudimentary attempts at fixing possible SELinux issues
	  - For this to work, the report must be placed in the normal www 
	    directory (usually /var/www/html or /srv/www/html)
	* Fixed 'Show old reports' not necessarily showing all it should.
	* Tested with Zabbix 5.0 and PHP 7.2

2020-07-28 Martin Møller <martin.moller@pwc.com> - Update to v1.2.3
	* Fixed it so that $2 in item graphs gets resolved.

2021-01-20 Martin Møller <martin.moller@pwc.com> - Update to v1.2.4
	* Tried to make trends/SLA more robust and provide information on
	number of data points used to generate it.
	* Extra code to assume milliseconds are not a fraction if value over 8

PLANNED:
	* Look into excluding headlines for empty sections (requires rewriting
	some parts of the generator code).
	* HTML data for triggers/acknowledgements with fuller details. Right
	now only the subject is shown in the PDF (or the message in the case
	of acknowledgements). The reports would tend to get pretty big if the
	full body of the event is included. I plan to make the events
	collapsible, mostly like the 'show old reports' functionality from
	Ronny.
	* The option to selectively choose what graphs, items and triggers are
	included in the report. This would probably have to be done by
	redirecting to a new page that fetches all object ids and their names
	and then checkboxes for each, resulting in perhaps three arrays that
	will be used in the graphing/reporting process. (Semi-done, see
	2018-09-13)
